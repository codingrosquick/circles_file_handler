# TODO:

# - next() method
#     - choose file exploration to use
#     - precomputed ones (small analysis, large all csv gps files coupled)
#     - use filtering, specific selections from those files
# - Being able to cut the file around the event
#     - Convert to bagfile
#     - Have methods around the next that can be set: processing_after_download() (just after the download), processing_before_next() (before the cache is cleared)
